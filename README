ENCODING DETECTOR

Detect encodings recursively over files in your project and kill
those nasty non-UTF files before they rob you of tiresome hours
that could be spent drinking beer instead!

This code was used once on a project far, far away. I haven't tried
to make it too generic or super helpful, but hopefully should be
enough to get things going. Contributions are most welcome and, if
someone wants to comment on my dated Python skills, feel free to
do so though the medium of patches ;)
